# Word-Guessing-Game
This is a generic word guessing game project.

The game takes a word from the words.txt file and the player is given five chances to guess the word. All words in this list are five letters long.

After each guess, the letters used are given a different color based on whether they were not in the word, in the word and in the wronge place, or in the word in the correct place. The game also informs the player of how many guesses they have left and a collection of letters that were misplaced or outright wrong. If the player enters an incorrect guess the program displays a message telling the player of this. If the player guesses the word correctly, it will take them out of the game loop and print a congratulatory message to the screen.

The game is also capable of determining whether the word provided is a valid word or not. If it contains more or less than five characters or any numbers or special characters, then the game prints that this was an invalid word. Should the player enter a series of escape words (quit, stop, end, or exit) the game will end immediately.
